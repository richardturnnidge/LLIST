# LLIST
MOSlet for printing to a thermal printer from mos/basic.
Currently set to 9600 baud rate as default.
Include a second param for baud rate of 19200

Put the latest bin file in your MOS folder. Rename it to LLIST.bin

Works fine from MOS.

Type: LLIST filename.txt  19200 (to change baud rate)

Works fine from within BBCBasic 24bit ADL version.

Not working correctly under BBCBasic 16bit
